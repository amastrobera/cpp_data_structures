# C++ Data strutures #


This repo contains my implementations of common data structures for aesthetic purposes. 

### Content libraries ###
A file for each structure and its unit test. 
If the implementation includes naked pointers, memory leaks are checked with Valgrind. 

#### Modifying STL libs ####
* interval map (derived from c++11 std::map)

#### Making containiers from scratch  ####
C++03, naked pointers, built with Makefile

* dynamic array (good to implement doubleNode or a Stack)
* node, single and double 
* linked_list unordered single (good to implement a Stack)
* linked_list single


### todo ###
* more functions in dynamic array (vector)
* linked list double
* map (as a normal tree, if possible as a RB tree)
