# C++ Data strutures #


This repo contains my implementations of common data structures for aesthetic purposes. 

### Content libraries ###
A file for each structure and its unit test. 
If the implementation includes naked pointers, memory leaks are checked with Valgrind. 

#### Modifying STL libs ####
* interval map (derived from c++11 std::map)

#### Making containiers from scratch  ####
C++03, naked pointers, built with Makefile

* node, single and double 
* linked_list, singly

### todo ###
* linked list, double + class structure + node class 
* map (as a normal tree, if possible as a RB tree)
